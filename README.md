## Summary
This was my first full, feature complete front-end web project.

Using a randomly generated RGB value, players must determine which square matches the value.

The RGB Color Game uses a difficulty magic number to determine the number of squares to display on the play space.

We also use this number to generate d number of random colors. We assign those colors to squares and create listeners for each square that match the square's color against the target color.
